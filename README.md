### Overview
While visiting New York City, we see that part of what keeps the city running are CitiBikes! Hundreds of thousands of people use CitiBikes everyday to commute. After seeing how essential those bikes are, we decided to bring the idea to DeMoines, Iowa, while thinking of all the possible changes we'd have to take into account considering DeMoines being smaller and more spread out than NYC.

- 146,752 CitiBike users have used the bikes for 5-minute rides, which is the most commonly seen trip duration. Very few users have biked a full hour!
- This chart shows us that the majority of CitiBike users are male, with an average trip duration of 5 minutes. Females have an average trip duration of 6 minutes.

- Males and females have very similar start times and the same pattern of days that have most frequent use (Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri), the difference is the number of users, since males seem to utilize citibike more frequently than females.

- This sheet shows that subscribers utilize CitiBike much more frequently than non-subscribing customers; getting their money's worth! This also shows that males in all situations seem to use CitiBike more than females.

### Summary
Overall, it seems that CitiBike could be useful for DeMoines if there are changes made in the business model. Since subscribers seem to be more avid users of CitiBikes, it would be helpful to advertise and encourage people to become subscribers, possibly while providing discounts. Repair times may have to change slightly depending on the pattern of bike use we would see in DeMoines. 
- A visualization I would perform is one that would help predict the number of possible CitiBike users in DeMoines based on DeMoines' population.
- Another visualization I would to perform is the age of users and subscribers, to see if there is a specific age group that should be targeted when we are promoting this idea in DeMoines.
